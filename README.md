The **Mindful Returns Counter** is a simple app designed to help track moments of mental drifting and awareness. Each time you notice that you've been lost in thought, distracted, or not present in the moment, you log it by pressing a button:  

- **Right Button** â†’ A short moment of drifting.  
- **Left Button** â†’ A longer period of being unaware.  

This helps build mindfulness by bringing awareness to how often the mind wanders.

### **Future Features** ðŸš€  
ðŸ”¹ **Statistics & Insights** â€“ Track improvements in mindfulness over time.  
ðŸ”¹ **Sleep & Emotional Logging** â€“ Analyze how sleep, mood, and physical state affect awareness.  
ðŸ”¹ **Session Tracking** â€“ Observe trends in focus and presence throughout the day.  

By consistently using the app, you'll develop a stronger ability to stay present in the moment.
